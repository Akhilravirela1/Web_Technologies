    <h2>Process</h2>

  <p>
    - I started by outlining the basic structure and key elements needed - story data with stages, choices, consequences; functions to initialize, update the UI, handle choices, and end the game.<br>
    - I then focused on building out the story data with a starting point and a few main branches or paths to explore. I tried to come up with an imaginative fantasy theme and use evocative descriptions.<br>
    - With the core story data framed out, I worked on the updatePage() function that would dynamically populate the UI from the current state of the story. This involved clearing out and recreating the choice buttons each time.<br>
    - Next was the makeChoice() function for advancing the story when a choice was clicked, checking for ending states.<br>
    - Lastly, I worked on styling and making sure the full flow - initializing, making choices, reaching endings - worked properly.
  </p>

  <h2>Creative Choices</h2>  

  <p>
    - I went with a fantasy theme and "realm of legends" concept to provide a sense of adventure and wonder, with various locales like an enchanted forest, mystic tower, and dark cavern.<br>
    - The choices present forks leading to different narrative threads and a variety of scenes or outcomes. I tried to make the consequences interesting and reinforce the themes.<br>
    - I spent time searching for compelling, immersive public domain fantasy images to match each part of the story. Images really help set the scene and mood.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <p>
    - Structuring the story data took some iterations to get right for handling dynamic updates and choices. I overcame this by methodically building pieces out.<br>  
    - Creatively, it was challenging conveying an intriguing fantasy world while keeping things fairly simple. Focusing on strong descriptions for each branch was key.
  </p>

  <h2>Insights</h2>

  <p>
    - Supporting replayability by keeping the story open-ended allows for more longevity than a single fixed sequence.<br>
    - More complex story data structures open up possibilities like attributes, inventory, randomness - will be interesting to explore next level storytelling mechanics.
